### Brief Intro
Haoxuan Zhu is currently interning at Apple. He received his B.S. in Computer Engineering as James B. Angell Scholar from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor with summa cum laude and another B.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Shanghai Jiao Tong University. During his undergraduate years, he has explored various field from designing out-of-order processors to developing applications for mobile devices. His research mainly focused on computer architecture and accelerating machine learning models with both hardware and software. He was supervised by Professor Trevor Mudge and helped test a series of domain-specific accelerators, including Transmuter and TPU. He also has a profound interest in machine learning related topics.

### Long Long Intro
Hi, I am Haoxuan. Welcome to my website! Currently, I just graduated from two distinguished unviersities in 2020. I earned my B.S. in Computer Engineering from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, and another B.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Shanghai Jiao Tong Univerisity. 

I have a profound interest in **domain-specific accelerators** and **computer architecture (including OS)** due to the current contradiction between increasing demands for computing power from machine learning algorithms and limited improvements in processors’ efficiency. 

During my undergraduate study in computer engineering at the University of Michigan – Ann Arbor, I had the privileges to work with Professor Trevor Mudge and Xin He on accelerating machine learning models from both hardware and software perspectives. I believe acceleration can be achieved through specialization, which is designing different architectures optimized to specific tasks and writing corresponding software to maximize hardware usage. Therefore, I am very excited to undertake further study to develop customized accelerators, OS and supplementary software that exploit the potential of the hardware.

I am also interested in AI, machine learning and computer vision ~~(who aren't....)~~ Please feel free to checkout my side-projects.

In my leasure time, I enjoy playing the piano, and playing Switch, and watching movies. I also happen to know several talented software developers. Click [here](https://syiming.github.io) to **admire** one of them.
