你好,我是朱皓轩。

Hi, I am Haoxuan Zhu. Welcome to my website! Currently, I am a senior student focuing on Computer Engineering at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. I also have a becholar's degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Shanghai Jiao Tong University in China.

I have a profound interest in **domain-specific accelerators** and **computer architecture (including OS)** due to the current contradiction between increasing demands for computing power from machine learning algorithms and limited improvements in processors’ efficiency. 

During my undergraduate study in computer engineering at the University of Michigan – Ann Arbor, I had the privileges to work with Professor Trevor Mudge and Xin He on accelerating machine learning models from both hardware and software perspectives. I believe acceleration can be achieved through specialization, which is designing different architectures optimized to specific tasks and writing corresponding software to maximize hardware usage. Therefore, I am very excited to undertake further study to develop customized accelerators and supplementary software that exploit the potential of the hardware.

I am also interested in AI, machine learning and computer vision ~~(who aren't....)~~ Please feel free to checkout my side-projects.

In my leasure time, I enjoy playing the piano, and playing Switch, and watching movies. I also happen to know several talented software developers. Click [here](https://syiming.github.io) to **admire** one of them.
